# Movie Recommendation System

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a content-based Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes movie metadata—such as genres, keywords, taglines, cast, and directors—to recommend titles similar to a user's favorite movie.

## Dataset Link
* **Dataset:** [Movies CSV Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshshinde8/movies-csv)

## Libraries Used
* **`pandas`**: Used for data loading, manipulation, and cleaning missing values.
* **`scikit-learn`**:
  * `TfidfVectorizer`: Transforms textual metadata into numerical feature vectors.
  * `NearestNeighbors`: ML model used to find similar movies based on cosine distance.
* **`kagglehub`**: Automates dataset downloading directly into the Google Colab environment.
* **`difflib`**: Standard Python module used for string matching to handle slight user typos in movie titles.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   * Textual metadata features (`genres`, `keywords`, `tagline`, `cast`, `director`) are selected from the dataset.
   * Missing values (`NaN`) are replaced with empty strings.
   * All selected attributes are combined into a unified text feature string for each movie.
2. **Text Vectorization:**
   * The combined text data is passed through `TfidfVectorizer` to produce a high-dimensional TF-IDF feature matrix.
3. **Model Training:**
   * An unsupervised `NearestNeighbors` model configured with `metric="cosine"` and `algorithm="brute"` is fitted on the TF-IDF feature vectors.
4. **Recommendation Generation:**
   * The user enters a movie title, which is matched against dataset entries using `difflib.get_close_matches`.
   * The vector of the matched movie is queried against the `NearestNeighbors` model to retrieve the nearest vector points.
   * The corresponding movie titles are displayed as final recommendations.

## Results
* Given an input movie (e.g., **"Avatar"**), the system successfully processes the metadata and returns the top 5 most similar movies based on shared genre tags, plot keywords, directing style, and cast line-up.
* The model efficiently handles typos and returns fast, scalable vector distance searches using K-Nearest Neighbors.

## Conclusion
This content-based recommendation system demonstrates how unsupervised machine learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors) combined with NLP techniques (TF-IDF) can effectively process text metadata to generate personalized recommendations without requiring historical user interaction or rating data.
