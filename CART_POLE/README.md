# CartPole Reinforcement Learning Agent (PPO)

A reinforcement learning agent trained to solve the classic **CartPole-v1** control problem using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** from Stable-Baselines3.

---

## Overview

CartPole is a classic control benchmark from OpenAI Gym / Gymnasium. The goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart by applying left/right forces, keeping the pole upright for as long as possible.

This project trains a PPO agent to solve the environment, evaluates its performance, and visualizes the trained policy in action.

| **Environment** | `CartPole-v1` (Gymnasium) |
| **Algorithm** | PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) |
| **Library** | Stable-Baselines3 |
| **Training steps** | 100,000 timesteps |
| **Max episode reward** | 500 |
| **Platform** | Google Colab (CPU) |

## Problem Setup

**State space (4 continuous values):**
- Cart position
- Cart velocity
- Pole angle
- Pole angular velocity

**Action space (2 discrete actions):**
- Push cart left
- Push cart right

**Reward:** +1 for every timestep the pole remains upright. An episode ends when the pole falls past a threshold angle, the cart moves out of bounds, or 500 timesteps are reached.

**Solved criterion:** Average reward ≥ 475 over 100 consecutive episodes (per Gymnasium's definition). A mean reward close to 500 during evaluation indicates a fully trained agent.

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Mean evaluation reward | ~500.00 |
| Standard deviation | ~0.00 |
| Training time (Colab CPU) | ~2–5 minutes |
| Episodes to convergence | ~200–400 |

## Key Design Choices

- **PPO** was chosen over DQN for its stability, ease of tuning, and strong out-of-the-box performance on low-dimensional control tasks.
- **Vectorized environments** (`n_envs=4`) were used to collect experience in parallel, significantly reducing wall-clock training time.
- **Deterministic evaluation** (`deterministic=True`) is used at test time to assess the agent's learned policy without exploration noise.

## Future Improvements

- Extend to harder control environments (e.g. LunarLander-v3, BipedalWalker)
- Compare PPO against DQN and A2C on the same environment
- Add TensorBoard logging for training curve visualization
- Hyperparameter tuning via Optuna
