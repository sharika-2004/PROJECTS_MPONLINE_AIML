# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

A deep learning project that classifies color images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of ten object categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project demonstrates the complete image classification pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance visualization using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset

- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Workflow

1. Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Normalize pixel values to improve model training.
3. Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
4. Train the model on the training dataset.
5. Evaluate performance on the test dataset.
6. Generate predictions on unseen images.
7. Visualize results using accuracy and loss graphs.
8. Analyze model performance with a confusion matrix and classification report.

## CNN Architecture

The model consists of:

- Three Convolutional Layers
- Three Max Pooling Layers
- Flatten Layer
- Fully Connected Dense Layer
- Dropout Layer for regularization
- Softmax Output Layer with 10 classes
